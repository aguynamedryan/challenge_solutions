## What is this?
Sets of solutions to challenges I've encountered on the internet.  Whenever possible, I include the text of the original question along with the solution.

I program predominantly in Ruby or C.  To challenge myself and grow as a developer, I intend to use other languages, when possible, to write my solutions.


## What's in it?
Currently there is a single set of solutions as I've only completed one challenge so far.  I intend to add sets as I complete challenges.


## Descriptions of Sets
* Set 1
  * Solutions are in Python
  * Completed April 24, 2012
  * Time allotted: 1.75 hours
  * Completed in: 1.25 hours
